PROTOCOL ON STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENTALASSESSMENT
TO THE CONVENTION ON ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
IN A TRANSBOUNDARY CONTEXT
The Parties to this Protocol,
Recognizing
the
importance
of
integrating
environmental, including health, considerations into the
preparation and adoption of plans and programmes and, to
the extent appropriate, policies and legislation,
Committing themselves to promoting sustainable
development and therefore basing themselves on the
conclusions
of
the
United
Nations
Conference
on
Environment and Development (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
1992), in particular principles 4 and 10 of the Rio
Declaration
on
Environment
and
Development
and
Agenda 21, as well as the outcome of the third Ministerial
Conference on Environment and Health (London, 1999)
and the World Summit on Sustainable Development
(Johannesburg, South Africa, 2002),
Bearing in mind the Convention on Environmental
Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context, done at
Espoo, Finland, on 25 February 1991, and decision II/9 of
its Parties at Sofia on 26 and 27 February 2001, in which it
was decided to prepare a legally binding protocol on
strategic environmental assessment,
Recognizing that strategic environmental assessment
should have an important role in the preparation and
adoption
of
plans,
programmes,
and,
to
the
extent
appropriate, policies and legislation, and that the wider
application of the principles of environmental impact
assessment to plans, programmes, policies and legislation
will further strengthen the systematic analysis of their
significant environmental effects,
Acknowledging
the
Convention
on
Access
to
Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and
Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, done at
Aarhus, Denmark, on 25 June 1998, and taking note of the
relevant paragraphs of the Lucca Declaration, adopted at
the first meeting of its Parties,
Conscious, therefore, of the importance of providing
for
public
participation
in
strategic
environmental
assessment,
Acknowledging the benefits to the health and wellbeing of present and future generations that will follow if
the need to protect and improve people’s health is taken
into account as an integral part of strategic environmental
assessment, and recognizing the work led by the World
Health Organization in this respect,
Mindful of the need for and importance of enhancing
international cooperation in assessing the transboundary
environmental, including health, effects of proposed plans
