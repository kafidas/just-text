Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications concerning Higher Education in the European Region
Lisbon, 11.IV.1997
Preamble
The Parties to this Convention,
Conscious of the fact that the right to education is a human right, and that higher education, which
is instrumental in the pursuit and advancement of knowledge, constitutes an exceptionally rich
cultural and scientific asset for both individuals and society;
Considering that higher education should play a vital role in promoting peace, mutual
understanding and tolerance, and in creating mutual confidence among peoples and nations;
Considering that the great diversity of education systems in the European region reflects its
cultural, social, political, philosophical, religious and economic diversity, an exceptional asset
which should be fully respected;
Desiring to enable all people of the region to benefit fully from this rich asset of diversity by
facilitating access by the inhabitants of each State and by the students of each Party's educational
institutions to the educational resources of the other Parties, more specifically by facilitating their
efforts to continue their education or to complete a period of studies in higher education
institutions in those other Parties;
Considering that the recognition of studies, certificates, diplomas and degrees obtained in another
country of the European region represents an important measure for promoting academic mobility
between the Parties;
Attaching great importance to the principle of institutional autonomy, and conscious of the need
to uphold and protect this principle;
Convinced that a fair recognition of qualifications is a key element of the right to education and a
responsibility of society;
Having regard to the Council of Europe and Unesco Conventions covering academic recognition in
Europe:
–
European Convention on the Equivalence of Periods of University Study (1956, ETSNo.
21);
–
European Convention on the Academic Recognition of University Qualifications (1959,ETS
No. 32);
–
European Convention on the Equivalence of Diplomas leading to Admission to
Universities (1953, ETS No. 15), and its Protocol (1964, ETS No. 49);
–
Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Diplomas and Degrees concerning Higher
Education in the States belonging to the Europe Region (1979);
–
European Convention on the General Equivalence of Periods of University Study (1990,ETS
No. 138);
Having regard also to the International Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Diplomas and
Degrees in Higher Education in the Arab and European States bordering on the Mediterranean
(1976), adopted within the framework of Unesco and partially covering academic recognition in
Europe;
Mindful that this Convention should also be considered in the context of the Unesco conventions
and the international recommendation covering other Regions of the world, and of the need for
an improved exchange of information between these Regions;
Conscious of the wide ranging changes in higher education in the European region since these
conventions were adopted, resulting in considerably increased diversification within and between
national higher education systems, and of the need to adapt the legal instruments and practice to
reflect these developments;
Conscious of the need to find common solutions to practical recognition problems in the European
region;
Conscious of the need to improve current recognition practice and to make it more transparent
and better adapted to the current situation of higher education in the European region;
Confident of the positive significance of a convention elaborated and adopted under the joint
auspices of the Council of Europe and Unesco providing a framework for the further development
of recognition practices in the European region;
Conscious of the importance of providing permanent implementation mechanisms in order to put
the principles and provisions of the current Convention into practice,

Section II – The competence of authorities
Article II.1
1.
Where central authorities of a Party are competent to make decisions in recognition cases, that
Party shall be immediately bound by the provisions of this Convention and shall take the
necessary measures to ensure the implementation of its provisions on its territory.
Where the competence to make decisions in recognition matters lies with components of the
Party, the Party shall furnish one of the depositories with a brief statement of its constitutional
situation or structure at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification,
acceptance, approval or accession, or any time thereafter. In such cases, the competent authorities
of the components of the Parties so designated shall take the necessary measures to ensure
implementation of the provisions of this Convention on their territory.
2.
Where the competence to make decisions in recognition matters lies with individual higher
education institutions or other entities, each Party according to its constitutional situation or
structure shall transmit the text of this Convention to these institutions or entities and shall
take all possible steps to encourage the favourable consideration and application of its
provisions.
3.
The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the
obligations of the Parties under subsequent articles of this Convention.
Article II.2
At the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or
accession, or at any time thereafter, each State, the Holy See or the European Community shall
inform either depository of the present Convention of the authorities which are competent to
make different categories of decisions in recognition cases.
Article II.3
Nothing in this Convention shall be deemed to derogate from any more favourable provisions
concerning the recognition of qualifications issued in one of the Parties contained in or stemming
from an existing or a future treaty to which a Party to this Convention may be or may become a
party.
Section III – Basic principles related to the assessment of qualifications
Article III.1
1. Holders of qualifications issued in one of the Parties shall have adequate access, upon
request to the appropriate body, to an assessment of these qualifications.
2. No discrimination shall be made in this respect on any ground such as the applicant's gender, race,
colour, disability, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin,
association with a national minority, property, birth or other status, or on the grounds of any other
circumstance not related to the merits of the qualification for which recognition is sought. In order to
assure this right, each Party undertakes to make appropriate arrangements for the assessment of an
application for recognition of qualifications solely on the basis of the knowledge and skills achieved.
Article III.2
Each Party shall ensure that the procedures and criteria used in the assessment and recognition of
qualifications are transparent, coherent and reliable.
Article III.3
 Decisions on recognition shall be made on the basis of appropriate information on the
qualificationsforwhichrecognitionissought.
 Inthefirstinstance,theresponsibilityforprovidingadequateinformationrestswiththe
applicant,whoshallprovidesuchinformationingoodfaith.
 Notwithstanding the responsibility of the applicant, the institutions having issued the
qualificationsinquestionshallhaveadutytoprovide,uponrequestoftheapplicantandwithin
reasonablelimits,relevantinformationtotheholderofthequalification,totheinstitution,orto
thecompetentauthoritiesofthecountryinwhichrecognitionissought.
 ThePartiesshallinstructorencourage,asappropriate,alleducationinstitutionsbelongingtotheir
educationsystemstocomplywithanyreasonablerequestforinformationforthepurposeof
assessingqualificationsearnedatthesaidinstitutions.
5. The responsibility to demonstrate that an application does not fulfil the relevant requirements
lies with the body undertaking the assessment.
Article III.4
Each Party shall ensure, in order to facilitate the recognition of qualifications, that adequate and
clear information on its education system is provided.
Article III.5
Decisions on recognition shall be made within a reasonable time limit specified beforehand by the
competent recognition authority and calculated from the time all necessary information in the
case has been provided. If recognition is withheld, the reasons for the refusal to grant recognition
shall be stated, and information shall be given concerning possible measures the applicant may
take in order to obtain recognition at a later stage. If recognition is withheld, or if no decision is
taken, the applicant shall be able to make an appeal within a reasonable time limit.
Section IV – Recognition of qualifications giving access to higher education
Article IV.1
Each Party shall recognise the qualifications issued by other Parties meeting the general
requirements for access to higher education in those Parties for the purpose of access to
programmes belonging to its higher education system, unless a substantial difference can be
shown between the general requirements for access in the Party in which the qualification was
obtained and in the Party in which recognition of the qualification is sought.
Article IV.2
Alternatively, it shall be sufficient for a Party to enable the holder of a qualification issued in one
of the other Parties to obtain an assessment of that qualification, upon request by the holder, and
the provisions of Article IV.1 shall apply mutatis mutandis to such a case.
Article IV.3
Where a qualification gives access only to specific types of institutions or programmes of higher
education in the Party in which the qualification was obtained, each other Party shall grant holders
of such qualifications access to similar specific programmes in institutions belonging to its higher
education system, unless a substantial difference can be demonstrated between the requirements
for access in the Party in which the qualification was obtained and the Party in which recognition
of the qualification is sought.
Article IV.4
Where admission to particular higher education programmes is dependent on the fulfilment of
specific requirements in addition to the general requirements for access, the competent
authorities of the Party concerned may impose the additional requirements equally on holders of
qualifications obtained in the other Parties or assess whether applicants with qualifications
obtained in other Parties fulfil equivalent requirements.
Article IV.5
Where, in the Party in which they have been obtained, school leaving certificates give access to
higher education only in combination with additional qualifying examinations as a prerequisite for
access, the other Parties may make access conditional on these requirements or offer an
alternative for satisfying such additional requirements within their own educational systems. Any
State, the Holy See or the European Community may, at the time of signature or when depositing
its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, or at any time thereafter, notify
one of the depositories that it avails itself of the provisions of this Article, specifying the Parties in
regard to which it intends to apply this Article as well as the reasons therefor.
Article IV.6
Without prejudice to the provisions of Articles IV.1, IV.2, IV.3, IV.4 and IV.5, admission to a given
higher education institution, or to a given programme within such an institution, may be restricted
or selective. In cases in which admission to a higher education institution and/or programme is
selective, admission procedures should be designed with a view to ensuring that the assessment
of foreign qualifications is carried out according to the principles of fairness and nondiscrimination described in Section III.
Article IV.7
Without prejudice to the provisions of Articles IV.1, IV.2, IV.3, IV.4 and IV.5, admission to a given
higher education institution may be made conditional on demonstration by the applicant of
sufficient competence in the language or languages of instruction of the institution concerned, or
in other specified languages.
Article IV.8
In the Parties in which access to higher education may be obtained on the basis of non- traditional
qualifications, similar qualifications obtained in other Parties shall be assessed in a similar manner
as non-traditional qualifications earned in the Party in which recognition is sought.
Article IV.9
For the purpose of admission to programmes of higher education, each Party may make the
recognition of qualifications issued by foreign educational institutions operating in its territory
contingent upon specific requirements of national legislation or specific agreements concluded
with the Party of origin of such institutions.
Section V – Recognition of periods of study Article V.1
Each Party shall recognise periods of study completed within the framework of a higher education
programme in another Party. This recognition shall comprise such periods of study towards the
completion of a higher education programme in the Party in which recognition is sought, unless
substantial differences can be shown between the periods of study completed in another Party
and the part of the higher education programme which they would replace in the Party in which
recognition is sought.
Article V.2
Alternatively, it shall be sufficient for a Party to enable a person who has completed a period of
study within the framework of a higher education programme in another Party to obtain an
assessment of that period of study, upon request by the person concerned, and the provisions of
Article V.1 shall apply mutatis mutandis to such a case.
Article V.3
In particular, each Party shall facilitate recognition of periods of study when:
a.
there has been a previous agreement between, on the one hand, the higher education
institution or the competent authority responsible for the relevant period of study and, on the
other hand, the higher education institution or the competent recognition authority responsible
for the recognition that is sought; and
b.
the higher education institution in which the period of study has been completed has issued
a certificate or transcript of academic records attesting that the student has successfully
completed the stipulated requirements for the said period of study.
Section VI – Recognition of higher education qualifications
Article VI.1
To the extent that a recognition decision is based on the knowledge and skills certified by the
higher education qualification, each Party shall recognise the higher education qualifications
conferred in another Party, unless a substantial difference can be shown between the qualification
for which recognition is sought and the corresponding qualification in the Party in which
recognition is sought.
Article VI.2
Alternatively, it shall be sufficient for a Party to enable the holder of a higher education
qualification issued in one of the other Parties to obtain an assessment of that qualification, upon
request by the holder, and the provisions of Article VI.1 shall apply mutatis mutandis to such a
case.
Article VI.3
Recognition in a Party of a higher education qualification issued in another Party shall have one or
both of the following consequences:
a.
access to further higher education studies, including relevant examinations, and/or to
preparations for the doctorate, on the same conditions as those applicable to holders of
qualifications of the Party in which recognition is sought;
b.
the use of an academic title, subject to the laws and regulations of the Party or a jurisdiction
thereof, in which recognition is sought.
In addition, recognition may facilitate access to the labour market subject to laws and regulations
of the Party, or a jurisdiction thereof, in which recognition is sought.
Article VI.4
An assessment in a Party of a higher education qualification issued in another Party may take the
form of:
a.
advice for general employment purposes;
b.
advice to an educational institution for the purpose of admission into its programmes;
c.
advice to any other competent recognition authority.
Article VI.5
Each Party may make the recognition of higher education qualifications issued by foreign
educational institutions operating in its territory contingent upon specific requirements of national
legislation or specific agreements concluded with the Party of origin of such institutions.
Section VII –
Recognition of qualifications held by refugees, displaced persons and persons in a
refugee-like situation
Article VII
Each Party shall take all feasible and reasonable steps within the framework of its education system
and in conformity with its constitutional, legal, and regulatory provisions to develop procedures
designed to assess fairly and expeditiously whether refugees, displaced persons and persons in a
refugee-like situation fulfil the relevant requirements for access to higher education, to further
higher education programmes or to employment activities, even in cases in which the
qualifications obtained in one of the Parties cannot be proven through documentary evidence.
Section VIII – Information on the assessment of higher education institutions and programmes
Article VIII.1
Each Party shall provide adequate information on any institution belonging to its higher education
system, and on any programme operated by these institutions, with a view to enabling the
competent authorities of other Parties to ascertain whether the quality of the qualifications issued
by these institutions justifies recognition in the Party in which recognition is sought. Such
information shall take the following form:
a.
in the case of Parties having established a system of formal assessment of higher education
institutions and programmes: information on the methods and results of this assessment, and
of the standards of quality specific to each type of higher education institution granting, and to
programmes leading to, higher education qualifications;
b.
in the case of Parties which have not established a system of formal assessment of higher
education institutions and programmes: information on the recognition of the various
qualifications obtained at any higher education institution, or within any higher education
programme, belonging to their higher education systems.
Article VIII.2
Each Party shall make adequate provisions for the development, maintenance and provision of:
a.
an overview of the different types of higher education institutions belonging to its higher
education system, with the typical characteristics of each type of institution;
b.
a list of recognised institutions (public and private) belonging to its higher education system,
indicating their powers to award different types of qualifications and the requirements for
gaining access to each type of institution and programme;
c.
a description of higher education programmes;
d.
a list of educational institutions located outside its territory which the Party considers as
belonging to its education system.
Section IX – Information on recognition matters
Article IX.1
In order to facilitate the recognition of qualifications concerning higher education, the Parties
undertake to establish transparent systems for the complete description of the qualifications
obtained.
Article IX.2
1. Acknowledging the need for relevant, accurate and up-to-date information, each Party shall
establish or maintain a national information centre and shall notify one of the depositories of its
establishment, or of any changes affecting it.
2. In each Party, the national information centre shall:
a.
facilitate access to authoritative and accurate information on the higher education
system and qualifications of the country in which it is located;
b.
facilitate access to information on the higher education systems and qualifications
of the other Parties;
c.
give advice or information on recognition matters and assessment of qualifications,
in accordance with national laws and regulations.
3. Every national information centre shall have at its disposal the necessary means to enable it
to fulfil its functions.
